## Temporary API Access

To enable the Quote Generator to fetch quotes from an external API, we use a CORS proxy server. You can get temporary access to the API by following these steps:

1. Visit the [CORS Anywhere Demo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) page.

2. Click on the "Request temporary access to the demo server" button.

3. You will receive a temporary link. Copy the link.

4. Open the `script.js` file in your project.

5. Find the line where the API URL is defined and replace it with the temporary link you copied in step 3.

6. Save the `script.js` file.
